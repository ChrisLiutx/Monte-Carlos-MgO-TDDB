# Monte-Carlos-MgO-TDDB
Monte Carlos simulation of Magnesium Oxide time dependent dielectric breakdown

We simulate the breakdown of STTMRAM CoFeB-MgO-CoFeB stack with the Kinetic Monte Carlos (KMC) technique. The simulated crystal structure is BCC (like NaCl) with 001 interface with CoFeB of 350x350x5 cells in size. We hypothesize that MgO can breakdown via two mechanisms: 1. Defect clustering 2. Defect diffusion. We suspect that the main defect in MgO is O-vacancies in the crystal. The purpose of this simulation is to quantitatively determine which mechanism best fits experimental MgO breakdown data. Rates for the simulation are determined from physical constants and a separate atomistic simulatiom. 

Detatils on KMC technique can be found in the Resources folder.
