What are the parameters/ types of systems we're running?
Diffusion vs filament growth
hash map wheeee
what are the types of processes, how it changes, how the kp changes.
general vs specific algo

defect generation (bond breaking)
moving to neighboring lattice (diffusion/ drift)
annihilating itself

3 for bulk and interface each

assume defects influence neighbors, calculate neighboring cell that has defects

diffusion/ drift, 1 process per neighbor?
